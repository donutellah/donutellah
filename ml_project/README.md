# First ML Project

This project compares two machine learning models — **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor** — using a solubility dataset.



📁 **Dataset**



Source: \[Delaney Solubility Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dataprofessor/data/refs/heads/master/delaney\_solubility\_with\_descriptors.csv)

Goal: Predict water solubility based on molecular structure descriptors.



**Models Used**



*- Linear Regression*

*- Random Forest Regressor*



**Summary**



\- Linear Regression performed slightly better on the test set.

\- Random Forest had lower generalization performance, possibly due to overfitting.
